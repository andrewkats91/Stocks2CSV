Stocks2CSV

Like its unity predaccessor, its just a small app I made that quickly makes a csv. It isnt written to be readable or whatever, I just update it when they add different formatting to their PDFs. If they add too many ill make the code a bit more readable, but for what I needed it does the job.

It doesnt have comments or anything fancy because I wrote it very quickly for myself to make some data I needed. 
But it can easily be extrapolated into a cleaner, more usable application.
